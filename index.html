            <h2>Systems Biology</h2>
            <p>I am deeply passionate about network biology and algorithmics, which form the core of my research in systems biology. My work focuses on understanding the complex interactions within biological systems and developing computational models to analyze these networks.</p>
            <p>One of my notable projects is FALCON, my PhD baby. This project represents a significant milestone in my academic journey and showcases my ability to combine theoretical knowledge with practical applications. Through FALCON, I have explored innovative approaches to modeling and analyzing biological networks.</p>
            <p>My technical skills include proficiency in Python and Matlab, which I use extensively for data analysis and algorithm development. My ability to understand and interpret complex data sets has been crucial in driving my research forward.</p>
            <p>Although I am one of many researchers in the field of systems biology, I am motivated by the potential to make a difference. I hope that my contributions, no matter how minor, will add value to the broader scientific community and help address some of the pressing challenges in biology and medicine.</p>
            <p>In recognition of my work, I have been awarded a PhD, which is a testament to my dedication and expertise in the field. I am excited to continue my research and explore new frontiers in systems biology.</p>
            <p>Below are some of my publications and presentations related to systems biology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="publication1.pdf" target="_blank">Title of Publication 1</a></li>

            <h2>Chess</h2>
            <p>My journey with chess began in my childhood when my father introduced me to the game through the 8-pawns challenge. I recently implemented this game, do not hesitate to try to play against the AI here (link). Since then, chess has been a significant part of my life, offering endless opportunities for growth and learning.</p>
            <p>One of my proudest achievements in chess is reaching a peak rating of 1282 on chess.com. While this may not be the highest rating, it represents my dedication and passion for the game.</p>
            <p>In addition to playing, I am also an active member of the chess community. I founded the chess club in Arlon, Belgium, where I not only play but also give chess courses to help others improve their skills. Sharing my knowledge and enthusiasm for the game is incredibly rewarding.</p>
            <p>What I love most about chess is its constant challenge. Every game is a new struggle, requiring strategic thinking and mental endurance. It's never easy, but that's what makes it so captivating and satisfying.</p>
            <p>As for my playing style, I enjoy employing the Italian Game when playing as White and the Stafford Gambit when playing as Black. These openings align well with my strategic approach and provide exciting opportunities during the game.</p>
